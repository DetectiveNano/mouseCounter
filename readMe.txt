This code was written by me, DetectiveNano, on 5/6/20
It does not store, log, or transmit mouse data outside of the program and all it does in the program is count up.
If there is an issue, message me somehow and I'll try to fix it.

When you run the exe, wait for the window to exist before clicking.
If you click too early the updating won't work. So wait until a little window pops up with the mouse click data on it.
